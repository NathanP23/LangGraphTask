Project Manager: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's sprint planning session. Let's review what we accomplished last sprint and plan for the next two weeks.

Sarah: Hi everyone! Last sprint went really well on the frontend side. We completed the user dashboard and the new navigation menu. Performance improvements are also looking good.

Mike: Great work Sarah! On the backend, we finished the API authentication system and deployed the new database schema. However, we're still seeing some latency issues with the user queries.

Project Manager: Thanks Mike. What's causing the latency issues?

Mike: It looks like our database indexes aren't optimized for the new query patterns. I think we need to spend some time this sprint on database optimization.

Sarah: That makes sense. Should I hold off on the advanced user features until the performance issues are resolved?

Project Manager: Good question. What do you think, Mike? Can you give us a timeline estimate?

Mike: I'd say give me 3-4 days to optimize the queries and indexes. After that, Sarah can proceed with the advanced features without performance concerns.

Sarah: Perfect! I can use those days to work on the mobile responsive design we've been postponing.

Project Manager: Excellent plan. So our sprint goals are: Mike owns database optimization by Thursday, Sarah handles mobile responsiveness, and then we tackle advanced user features. Any blockers or concerns?

Mike: No blockers on my end. I have everything I need.

Sarah: Same here, looks good to go!

Project Manager: Great! Let's plan to check in mid-week to see how we're progressing. Thanks everyone!
