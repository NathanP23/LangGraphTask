Hi Nathan,
Thanks again for your time yesterday!
As discussed, the next step in the process is a short home assignment. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

🧪 Take-Home Assignment – Communication Health Breakdown via LangGraph
Language: Any programming language
Requirements:
• Must use LangGraph (in any supported language)
• Must use an LLM of your choice (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

🎯 Objective
Build a LangGraph workflow that takes as input either:
• A thread of messages/emails, and/or
• A meeting transcript
…and produces a structured “communication health” breakdown.

📌 What You Need to Decide
You are free to define:
• What communication health means
• Which values, metrics, flags, or categories to output
• How to structure the graph nodes and LLM prompts to extract those
The model and logic are entirely up to you — the goal is to demonstrate your ability to analyze communication and structure insights through a reasoning workflow.

📤 Output
Your output should include:
• A structured JSON (or any readable format) with the communication analysis
• A short explanation (can be natural language) of why this result was reached

✅ Evaluation Criteria
We’re looking to assess:
• Your product thinking: how you model a vague concept like “relationship health”
• How you structure a LangGraph workflow to support that
• Readability and clarity of code
• Smart, purposeful use of LLM(s) in the graph

📎 Guidelines
• You must use LangGraph for the workflow (in any supported language)
• You must use an LLM in at least one part of the flow
• Please add a short explanation (README or inline) describing:
  • How the graph is structured
  • Why you chose your specific modeling approach
No need for a full working app, server, or UI — focus on the core logic and reasoning.

📅 Deadline
Please submit your assignment by Tuesday, September 16th.
You can share it via:
• A public GitHub repo
• A ZIP file
• Or any other way that works for you

Good luck 🙂
